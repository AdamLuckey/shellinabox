This is my fork of the ubuntu repo shellinabox, with some fixes.

To build the debian binary run (after cding into the repository):
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential debhelper autotools-dev binutils libssl-dev libpam0g-dev zlib1g-dev
./configure
make
dpkg-buildpackage
```
Original Readme
---
Build the package according to the information in INSTALL, then refer to
to the shellinaboxd.1 manual page, or the shellinaboxd.ps PostScript file
for detailed documentation.
