This is my fork of the ubuntu repo shellinabox, with some fixes.

  * Firefox/Chrome crach fixed.
  * Auto login enabled -- enable auto-login:
    - To set the username, set as follows: ```window.autologinuser = "ubuntu"```
    - To set password (optional), set as follows: ```window.autologinpassword = "abc123"```
    - Default pause between these is 2 seconds. To change set (eg 5 seconds): 
        ```window.autologinpasswordpause = 5000```


To build the debian binary run (after cding into the repository):
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential debhelper autotools-dev binutils libssl-dev libpam0g-dev zlib1g-dev
./configure
dpkg-buildpackage
```
